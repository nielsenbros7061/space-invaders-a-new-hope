# This GitHub repository is an in-progress game called Hope for the Galaxy. It is mainly based off of the canonical Star Wars material.


# Currently available:
# Choosing ships from the command line. You may choose 'awing', 'falcon', or 'xwing'. In the event that no choice is made or something invalid is given, the x-wing acts as default.
# Special abilities and universal fire. Pressing space shoots a laser blast at incoming tie fighters. Pressing the down key fires a quad-laser for the Millennium Falcon, an ion blast for the a-wing, and a proton torpedo for the x-wing.


# Currently in progress:
# Adding a start screen and levels via game.view

# Likely developments in the future:
# The adding of allies, the death star, and Yavin. Potentially other planets or missions.
